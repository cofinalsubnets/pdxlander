# pdxlander

This is a port of the classic X windows game XLander (1992) to the Playdate game console.
Gameplay is mostly unchanged, except the difficulty scaling with successful landings is
tweaked a little bit. Lateral thrusters are controlled with the d-pad, retro thrusters
with the A/B buttons or the crank.

XLander was originally written by Paul Riddle and Mike Friedman.
